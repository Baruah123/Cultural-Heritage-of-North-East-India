# Cultural Heritage of North East India

The **Cultural Heritage of North East India** project highlights the cultural diversity, history, and heritage of the North-Eastern region of India. The project uses modern web technologies to deliver an immersive and interactive experience. 

## Overview

North East India is home to diverse cultures, traditions, and heritage sites. This project offers:
- **State-wise cultural insights**
- **Interactive multimedia galleries**
- **Responsive design for mobile and desktop**
- **Geolocation-based map** showing cultural landmarks within a 40km radius of the userâ€™s location.
- **E-commerce platform** offering cultural products like handicrafts, traditional attire, and artwork for purchase.

## Features

### 1. **Interactive Map with Cultural Landmarks (40km Radius)**
- Integrated **Google Maps API** to display cultural landmarks within a 40km radius from the user's current location.
- Uses the **Geolocation API** to get user location and mark important heritage sites on the map.
- A circle is drawn around the user's location to indicate the 40km radius, within which cultural landmarks are highlighted using markers.
- Markers include descriptions of significant cultural spots such as museums, historical sites, and artisan markets.

### How It Works:
- **User Location**: The map automatically detects the user's current location (if geolocation permission is granted).
- **Cultural Markers**: Significant cultural landmarks within a 40km radius are marked with clickable icons that display information about each site.
